This is a [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) project. Node is nice because there is a module for everything.

Old projects would use npm for module management, but this project uses "[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)"

Once you have node and yarn installed, you should be good to go. 

## Running

`yarn run`

## Debugging

You will need a debug environment set up, but once you do, `yarn debug` will start the file and attach to it for you.
